# Antipoder

Antipode: In geography, an antipode of any point on the Earth is the point that is diametrically opposite to it. This means it is located on the direct opposite side of the Earth, such that a line drawn from the given point through the center of the Earth would end at the antipode. Essentially, if you were to tunnel straight through the Earth from your current location, the exit point would be your antipodal point.
